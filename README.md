GPA Tracker Web App
Introduction
Welcome to the GPA Tracker Web App, a project aimed at simplifying academic management. This web application streamlines the task of monitoring student grades and managing GPA with ease. Our team, comprising experts in HTML, Django, and MySQL, collaboratively crafted a user-friendly interface to ensure an intuitive experience.

With a focus on performance and responsiveness, we've leveraged Django's capabilities to build a robust backbone for the application. HTML's flexibility allows us to create clear and organized layouts, enhancing user interaction. Designed for students, educators, and administrators, GPA Tracker offers a standardized structure for seamless accessibility across all devices.

Join us in revolutionizing academic management with GPA Tracker Web App.
