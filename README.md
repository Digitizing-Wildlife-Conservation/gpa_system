GPA Tracker Web App
Introduction
Welcome to the GPA Tracker Web App, a project aimed at simplifying academic management. This web application streamlines the task of monitoring student grades and managing GPA with ease. Our team, comprising experts in HTML, Django, and MySQL, collaboratively crafted a user-friendly interface to ensure an intuitive experience.

With a focus on performance and responsiveness, we've leveraged Django's capabilities to build a robust backbone for the application. HTML's flexibility allows us to create clear and organized layouts, enhancing user interaction. Designed for students, educators, and administrators, GPA Tracker offers a standardized structure for seamless accessibility across all devices.

Join us in revolutionizing academic management with GPA Tracker Web App.

Testing
For testing, we adhere to the latest software engineering standards including ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 series, which provides a comprehensive approach to software testing. We have implemented both white-box testing and black-box testing methodologies.

White-box Testing
White-box testing, also known as clear-box testing, examines the internal structure of the application. It ensures that all code paths are tested and that the application functions correctly according to its specifications. This testing approach is crucial for verifying the correctness of individual functions, algorithms, and modules within the system.

Black-box Testing
Black-box testing focuses on testing the functionality of the application without considering its internal implementation. Test cases are designed based on the application's requirements and specifications, and the tester evaluates the system's outputs against expected results. This approach helps uncover defects related to incorrect behavior, missing functionality, or usability issues from an end-user perspective.
